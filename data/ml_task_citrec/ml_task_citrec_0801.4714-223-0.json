{"context": "In this paper, we find a tight upper bound on the number of queries needed to break a key-agreement protocol in the random oracle model. Key-agreement protocols called Merkle's puzzles were constructed by Ralph Merkle in 1974 but only published in 1978\u00a0[1]. They are one of the earliest examples of public-key cryptographic protocols.\n", "citations": {"[1]": {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2047925852", "ref": "Merkle, R. C.
