{"context": "Until recently, the best upper bound on Eve's number of queries needed to break such protocols have been shown by Impagliazzo and Rudich\u00a0[1]. They prove that in any key-agreement protocol based on a random-permutation oracle, where Alice and Bob agree on the secret key in n  rounds in such a way that they query only one query per round (normal form of a protocol), Eve needs at most O(n\u00b3)  oracle queries to output a secret key guess that matches with Bob's secret key with the same probability as Alice's key does. For a protocol in the general form, O(n\u2076)  are sufficient for an attack, which can be proven by showing that any protocol can be transformed into its normal form with at most quadratic blow-up in the number of oracle queries made by the players. In\u00a0[1], the question is studied in the larger context to show that possibility of secure key-agreement relative to some random permutation oracle implies {\\rm P}\u2260 {\\rm NP} . In other words, proofs for showing that existence of one-way functions implies existence of secure key-agreement do not relativize.\n", "citations": {"[1]": {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2004881597", "ref": "Impagliazzo, R., and Rudich, S.
