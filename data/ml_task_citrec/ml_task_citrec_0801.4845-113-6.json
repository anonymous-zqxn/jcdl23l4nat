{"context": "The problem of broadcasting on directed radio networks has received much attention. The protocol given by [1] requires O(n\u00b2)  rounds for completion. This upper bound was reduced to O(n^\\frac{3}{2})  rounds by a breakthrough result of [2]. In a further breakthrough, [3], the authors deployed the probabilistic method to bring the upper bound from O(n \u0142g \u00b2\u2082 n)  to within logarithmic factors of the best known lower bound \u03a9 (n \u0142g \u2082 D) . In [4], a further improvement has been made for small diameter networks. They establish an upper bound of O(n \u0142g \u2082 n \u0142g \u2082 D) . In [5], the authors define and deploy new combinatorial structures to reduce this gap between lower and upper bounds to O(\u0142g \u2082 D)  factor i.e., give a broadcasting protocol running in O(n \u0142g \u00b2\u2082 D)  rounds.\n", "citations": {"[1]": {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2015356474", "ref": "B.S.
