{"context": "In fact, some encouraging work has been done in searching the MLSs for finite groups.\nAccording to the pioneering work due to Vasco et al. [1], Holmes [2] and Lempken et al. [3], we know that, with few exceptions, MLSs exist for all groups of order \u2264 10\u00b9\u2070 . Most recently, Nikhil Singhi, Nidhi Singhi, and Magliveras [4], [5] made another breakthrough: MLSs exist for the groups GL\u2099(q) , SL\u2099(q) , Sp\u2099(q)  with q  as a power of a prime\nand O\u2099(q)  with q  as a power of 2. As far as we know, this is the first result not constrained by a specified boundary on group orders. Besides, Nikhil Singhi and Nidhi Singhi [5] also pointed out, without any proof, that the MLSs should also exist for O\u2099(q)  with q  as a power of odd primes.\n", "citations": {"[1]": {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1983860602", "ref": "Gonz\u00e1lez Vasco M.I., R\u00f6tteler M., Steinwandt R.: On minimal length factorizations of finite groups.
