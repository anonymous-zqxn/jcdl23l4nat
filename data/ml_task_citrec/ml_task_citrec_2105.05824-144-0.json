{"context": "The dynamic range of real-world scenes varies over several orders of magnitude. However, standard digital camera sensors can only capture a limited fraction of this range. The resulting low-dynamic-range (LDR) images often have over- or under-exposed areas that cannot reflect our visual ability to perceive details in both bright and dark regions of a scene. Furthermore, information is lost in these regions which make vision tasks such as object detection [1] and visual tracking [2] difficult. High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging seeks to recover the lost information, and aims to produce an image that captures a broader range of illumination than is available from the sensor directly.\n", "citations": {"[1]": {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2565639579", "ref": "T.
